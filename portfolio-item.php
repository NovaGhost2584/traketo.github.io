					<p>Our virtual reality team worked with the architecture and interior design team at Pulse Design Group to create an innovative and unique care center in virtual reality. Spira Care, a new offering from Blue Cross Blue Shield, is a care center that offers easy access to services in a caring and welcoming environment. The center includes administrative offices, conference areas, care guide rooms, and an on-site pharmacy.</p>	
					<p>The Spira Care Centers were created through a collaboration between Helix, Pulse Design Group, Barkley, and Blue KC. The first Spira Care Center opened in January 2018 with more expected to open soon.</p>	
					<p>This VR project includes a photorealistic lobby, waiting area, conference room, and exam rooms. Users were able to visualize this environment using HTC Vive or Samsung GearVR. This project also included custom application deployment to support future project development.</p>	
					<span class="display-6">THE RESULTS:</span>
					<p>Virtual reality was instrumental in communicating the design of the completed environment to key stakeholders. The VR model was also helpful in providing a clear spatial understanding of the different rooms in the Spira Care Center. This virtual reality model was also leveraged as an asset for different Spira Care marketing initiatives.</p>
